## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **WebAssembly Integration:** PropleVM depends on WebAssembly runtime performance and security
  - *Mitigation:* Start with established runtimes and limit initial API surface

- **Cryptographic Implementation:** Identity and communication security are critical
  - *Mitigation:* Use established libraries and conduct regular security reviews

- **ActivityPub Federation:** Integration with existing networks may present challenges
  - *Mitigation:* Begin with basic compatibility and expand incrementally

### Resource Risks
- **Solo Developer Bandwidth:** Project scope is ambitious for a single developer
  - *Mitigation:* Strict prioritization and early community building

- **Technical Complexity:** Multiple complex systems must integrate seamlessly
  - *Mitigation:* Modular architecture with clear API boundaries

- **Timeline Extension:** Phases may take longer than anticipated
  - *Mitigation:* Regular milestone reviews and adjustment of scope

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1
- Number of vessel installations
- CLI command usage statistics
- Documentation completeness
- GitHub stars and community members

### Phase 2
- Number of sample extensions created
- Developer documentation usage
- Extension API stability
- Developer adoption (registered developers)

### Phase 3
- Number of connected vessels
- Message volume between vessels
- ActivityPub engagement metrics
- Third-party extension count

### Phase 4
- Name registrations
- Credential issuance metrics
- Social connection growth rate
- Identity verification completions

### Phase 5
- VSP node count
- Web interface usage metrics
- Transaction volume
- Marketplace growth statistics

## Next Steps

After completing the 30-month roadmap, potential directions include:

1. **Mobile Applications:** Native mobile clients for iOS and Android
2. **Enterprise Features:** Organization-specific capabilities
3. **Intelligence Layer:** Privacy-preserving AI features
4. **Interoperability:** Expanded cross-platform capabilities
5. **Governance Model:** Community governance implementation

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach for a solo developer to build the Prople platform over approximately 30 months. The phased approach focuses on delivering value incrementally while building toward the complete vision of digital sovereignty.

By targeting technical users first with a CLI interface and prioritizing the PropleVM extension system early, the roadmap creates a foundation that can attract contributors and scale beyond what a solo developer could build alone.
