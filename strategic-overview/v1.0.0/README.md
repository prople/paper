# Prople: Digital Sovereignty Platform - Strategic Overview

## About Prople

Prople is a digital sovereignty platform that empowers individuals and organizations to reclaim ownership and control of their digital presence across three critical domains:

* **Digital Identity**: Self-sovereign identity that users truly own and control
* **Social Connections**: User-owned social relationships and communications
* **Financial Assets**: Direct control of digital assets without intermediaries

The platform combines the best elements of Web2 usability with Web3 ownership principles, enhanced by an extensible architecture and intelligent assistance capabilities. At its core, Prople aims to restore the balance of power in the digital ecosystem by giving people back ownership of their digital lives.

Prople operates as an open ecosystem with a non-profit foundation at its center, focused on developing core technology and fostering community growth. The platform is built on open standards and protocols to ensure interoperability and long-term sustainability.

## Core Technical Architecture

Prople's architecture consists of four primary components:

1. **Personal Digital Agent (Vessel)**: The cornerstone of the platform, providing users with a personal digital representative that manages identity, connections, and assets. This agent can be self-hosted or managed through a service provider.

2. **Service Provider Network**: A decentralized network of providers that offer hosting and management services, making the platform accessible to non-technical users while maintaining sovereignty principles.

3. **Extension System (PropleVM)**: A secure framework powered by WebAssembly technology that allows third-party developers to build applications and services that enhance the platform's capabilities while respecting user control. This cross-platform extension system ensures extensions can run consistently across different environments while maintaining strong security boundaries.

4. **Intelligence Layer**: Privacy-preserving smart assistance that enhances user capabilities without compromising data ownership or privacy.

This modular architecture creates a flexible system that can adapt to different user needs while maintaining consistent sovereignty principles.
