# Background

## The Evolution Of Web: Read - Write - Own 

### Web1 - Read 

The era of `Web1` it's like the beginning adoption of the `Internet`. The `Internet` is a result of interconnected computer networks. `The Internet Protocol` is a set of rules used to communicate between networks and device on the `Internet`.

When the Internet introduced in the first time, there is a problem raise which is *sharing information* , like what already
been described by `The Father Of Web: Sir Tim Berners-Lee`:

> In those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer. Often it was just easier to go and ask people when they were having coffee…

Source: https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/

Short story, Tim introduced a new technology at that time, called as *hypertext*. The technology become what we know today as *HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)* and the beginning of the `Web1` era.

A those times, the *web* is provide a limited and static user experience, where an user only able to *read* the information, as what Tim try to solve the problem at the time this technology introduced, which is, sharing information.

With the technology, user able to read anything on the Internet in this era.

### Web2 - Write

The problem evolved, from limited and static user experiences, becomes the real time interactions, where an user able to share anything in Internet. They're not just read the information, but also able to create the information and also got the feedbacks in the realtime manners, it produces more interactive user experiences, where user able to interact with others.

Many tech companies start to raised at this time:

- MySpace
- Facebook
- YouTube

Web 2.0 is about creation and sharing of information delivered via the web.

### Web3 - Own

There is some ambigouty between the `Web3` and `Web 3.0`. The `Web 3.0` main concept is about "the semantic web", which try to making structured data available on the Internet. 

But in this paper, we will use term of `Web3`.

Taken from [The Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/about/) :

> A decentralized and fair internet where users control their own data, identity and destiny.
>
> - Users own their own data, not corporations
>
> - Global digital transactions are secure
>
> - Online exchanges of information and value are decentralized

The `Prople` inspired and designed on top of these missions and spritis, where `Prople` provides a solution to three core domain problems:

- `Decentralized Identity`
- `Decentralized Social`
- `Decentralized Finance`

> The only mission of `Prople` is to give back the ownership and control back to the people  

## Related Projects - Decentralized Movements

### SolidProject

The objective of this project are :

> - Your data, your choice.
>
> - Solid is an open standard for structuring data, digital identities, and applications on the Web.
>
> - Solid aims to support the creation of the Web as Sir Tim Berners-Lee originally envisioned it when he invented the Web at CERN in 1989. Tim sometimes refers to Solid as “the web - take 3" — or Web3.0 — because Solid integrates a new layer of standards into the Web we already have. The goal of Solid is for people to have more agency over their data.

This project was initiated by `The Father of the Web: Sir Tim Berners-Lee`, and the objective to make the `Web 3.0` become reality.

There is a concept of `Pod` from this project which is a *decentralized data stores*. Pods like secure personal web servers for your data.

Ref: https://solidproject.org/about

### AT Protocol & BlueSky

The tagline of this project is: *The Social Internet*

> The AT Protocol is a networking technology created to power the next generation of social applications

The `BlueSky` itself is an social application that provides global scale microblogging experience. This project introduce a decentralized social network protocols, which the network is not the private network owned by a single corporations, but it uses a *federated networks*.

This platform *identity management* already implement the `DID (Decentralized Identity)` standard.

Ref: https://atproto.com/docs

### Mastodon

Mastodon is a well-known project that also introduce the *decentralized social media*.

> Social networking that's not for sale
>
> Mastodon provides you with a unique possibility of managing your audience without middlemen.

The decentralized social networking protocol used at this platform is `ActivityPub`.

Ref: https://joinmastodon.org/

### Lens Protocol

This social network running on top of `Polgyon POS` network protocol, and will have their own network secured by `Ethereum` build on the ZK Stacks.

> Lens is an open social network that allows users to own their content and connections

This project introduce an interesting concept of `Profile NFT`. 

> The Profile NFT, a key element of the Lens Protocol, grants you control over your social graph and content
>
> An address can own multiple Profile NFTs, each maintaining a record of all posts, quotes, mirrors, comments, and other content created

Ref: https://www.lens.xyz/docs

## Evaluation

### The Open Standards

There is already existed the protocol standards for the `Identity` and also `Social Network`, which are:

- `Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)`
- `ActivityPub`

Both of these project already been official W3C recommended standards:

- [W3C: ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)
- [W3C: Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)

### The Chain Abstractions & Network Interoperability

Today, we have so many L1 / L2 networks in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and the problem of these multiple chain networks is about *interoperability*, because each of networks will be designed and built using different standards.

The need of *chain abstraction* is really important in cryptocurrency ecosystem. Too many networks available will makes user to use multiple wallets to manage their multiple identities and assets. 

There are several interesting projects that designed to solve this *interoperability* and *fragmented* issues. Some of them are:

- [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/)
- [Zetachain](https://www.zetachain.com/)
- [Axellar Network](https://www.axelar.network/)

## Prople Solutions

Unlike `AT Protocol` which try to create a new protocol, `Prople` will leverage current existing standards. To solve three core domain problems, `Prople` will use these standards:

- `Decentralized Identity` : implement `W3C DID` & `SSI (Self Sovereign Identity)` management
- `Decentralized Social` : implement `ActivityPub` and `IPLD`
- `Decentralized Finance` : will focus on *chain abstractions* and *interoperability* networks, which in the beginning it will running on top of `NEAR Protocol` and using other interoperability tools and network like `Zetachain` and `Axellar`. Specifically for the financial technology, `Prople` will only focus on the off-chain computation and tools.

The `Prople Vessel` heavy inspired from the `Solid Pod`. The difference with it is about the functionalities, which `Vessel` offer more functionalities. It's not just for the `personal data storage`, but a combination between `Crypto Wallet` and `SSI Agent`.

The `Prople Vessel` designed to be a *container* that deployed on server's environments, owned and controlled by a single *actor*. An user may have multiple *vessel agents* that deployed either in the same or different servers, and even user able to deploy it their *localhost*. User will able to be *connected* with others through their *vessel agents*. This single *container* will have functionalities to manage all of three core domain problems.

Unlike the `Solid Pod`, where user will required to setup their `Pods`, there is a concept of `VSP (Vessel Service Provider)`. This *service provider* is like an operator that want to setup `VSP` on their environments and be connected with other's *service operators*. These *operators* will interconnected each others to form a *decentralized and P2P network* of `PAIR (Prople Agent Identity Registry)`. The `VSP` operator, is like an *node operator* or *validators* in public blockchain networks which need to run a *node* that connected each others to form *decentralized & P2P cryptocurrency networks*. By providing this decentralized network, any non-technical users, will able to adopt this technology and setup their own `Prople Vessel Agent` through this network.
