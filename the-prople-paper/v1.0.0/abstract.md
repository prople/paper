# Abstract

This paper introduce a `Prople` project, it's a `Personalization Platform`. It combine experiences from the Web2 and Web3
designed specifically for the user's personal assets and activities. It manages three user's core domains:

- `Identity`,
- `Social` 
- `Finance`. 

For the `Identity`, this project implement the `Decentralized Identity (DID)` standard and derive the
functionality of `SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) Agent` to its own computation agent called `Prople Vessel`. The `Vessel` is a combination functionalities of `SSI Agent` and also `PDS (Personal Data Storage)`, which used to save and compute data. It's like a `Pod` from [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/). To support wide adoption, it will also provides `Vessel Service Provider (VSP)`, which is an open and decentralized networks where people can help to participate to form the `PAIR (Prople Agent Identity Registry)` decentralized network and a cluster of `Vessel`, so an user with non-technical background will able
to use this platform without need to setup any technical things.

For the `Social` activities, it will adopt current existed standards for the decentralized social networks, `ActivityPub`, which already implemented in current well-known decentralized network, `Mastodon`.

For the `Finance`, it will adopt the cryptocurrency to help user to manage their own financial assets in the decentralized and P2P networks. Specifically for this core domain, it will focus on the *Chain Abstractions* and *Network Interoperability* rather than creating or managing its own crypto network. For its *base network* it will using [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/), because this network protocol has same mission and vision about the *Chain Abstraction* and *Network Interoperability* including already provides base technology components of it so we can focus on our domains, besides this network protocol also already has a good performance and security standard as a the crypto network. 

Other networks to support *interoperability* like:

- [ZetaChain](https://www.zetachain.com/)
- [Omni Network](https://omni.network/)
- [Axellar Network](https://www.axelar.network/)

The core foundation domain for this platform is the `Identity`. As long as an user or an actor able to maintain and has a *true ownership* of their identities, they'll be able to own and manage anythings that important for them. The mission and vision of this project is to bring back the power and control back to the people which not controlled by any single entity, organization, company or institutions.
