# Conclusion

In this paper we've introduced the `Prople` and it's concept of `Personalization Platform`. While there is already existed the `Web3` technology, including blockchain, cryptocurrency, user already been introduced with the concept of *wallet* where they can manage their own crypto assets. `Prople` introduce more broader concepts.

`Prople` as *personalization platform* introduce new experience between `Web2` and `Web3` combined. This platform will push the *personalization* more than current *crypto wallet* can do. It's not eliminating the `Web2` or `Web3` experiences, it try to enrich both of user's experiences.

`Prople` not try to introduce a new standard or protocols, it designed and build on top of existing standard and protocols:

- `Self Sovereign Identity`
- `DID (Decentralized Identity)` by `W3C`
- `ActivityPub` and `Matrix Protocol`
- Existing *crytocurrency* networks, either it EVM (L1/L2) or non-EVM networks, and it has a chance someday will be integrated with the `Bitcoin` ecosystem through its L2 networks, such as `Stacks`

`Prople` provides the software, tools and decentralized networks through its `VSP P2P Networks` to help users maintain their *personalization* activities and assets through their *vessel*.
