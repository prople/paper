# Introduction

Today, software is almost anything, everything and everywhere, software is eating the world. Almost all human activities
today cannot be separated from software. We have a software to deliver our foods, help us to write a personal blog posts,
to pay anything, even for detect and monitor our heartbeats. Today's software designed to penetrate more deeply into our
lives as individuals.

Today's human interactions also mediated by software, like real-time messaging apps, dating apps, and social networks. We
as a human interact with others through some digital intermediaries where people gathered there in the some digital platforms.

For the business and all financial activities, almost goes everything through the digital intermediaries too. We have a digital bank, and a digital payment gateways. Almost all of our financial transactions happened through some software belongs to some institutions, no matter it's an old institution or new digital institutions.

Social, business and finance activities will always attached to an actor, either it's an user, organization or even just a
bot (the other software), which means, we must know that the activity or the asset is belongs to whom? The answer is, we need a *unique identity*. Without this *unique identity*, we will not know the activity's actors or the asset's owners. Imagine there is gold bar saved in some bank's vault without any identities to show its owners, is it mean that everyone will have *rights* to
own that gold? 

> The *Identity* is the core foundation of human activities. Without it, we don't know when we are talking or communicate with whom? Without it, there are no ownership of something in this world. Without it, everything will be ambigous, we need an *unique identifier* to eliminate this ambigous.

All of these components already been provided by current institutions or tech companies. Their software already provide solutions
for the social, business and finance activities and assets, by providing their own *Identity Management*. 

If an user want to interact with some digital platforms or networks, for whatever reasons, either for social or business activities, the first thing they have to do is to create their *unique identity* on that platforms or netowrks. All of user's
activities and assets, will belongs to their *identity* registered on that specific platforms. If an user need to access two
or more platforms or networks, it means they have to create their *identity* on those platforms, one by one. This is the reason
why we have the open standards for the *identity management* like `OpenID`.

> The real problem is not the *interoperability* or the standards, but who own and control the identity?

User's identitites will be saved on the platform or networks databases, a storage that an user will not have any access to it. User will only able to use their identity through the platform's application or software. This platform or organization will own it, they own, control and manage it. These institution or organization will have enough power and rights to do anything to their
user's identities, like edit or even remove it. It's because the data saved on their platforms. Once user's or actor's identities owned by some intermediaries or third-parties, all of their activities and assets means controlled by these organizations.

> There are no true ownership, no privacy and no control for the individual for their own identities, activities and assets 

Then comes the era when the `Bitcoin` born, it's the first decentralized and P2P cryptocurrency networks. A network where people
have their own *unique address* and able to maintain their *crytpo assets* called `BTC`. This *unique address* indicate the user's *unique identity* on that network, and it's secured cryptographically. At this network, user able to send their asset (`BTC`) through their unique addresses. And because it's P2P and decentralized, there are no centralized organization or institution own or control them.

`Prople` is an *open personalization platform* which aim to help *actors* to manage three important domains:

- `Identity`
- `Social`
- `Finance`

It has a `Prople Vessel` which is a `Actor Agent` that its functionalities derived from the concept of `SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) Agent`. The `Vessel` used as *digital representation* of an *actor*. It should be able to online as long as 7x24x365, and help an *actor* to manage their online activities. 

`Prople Vessel` is a software that has functionalities which combination of these three things:

- `SSI Agent`, used to manage identities
- `Social Agent`, used to manage any social activities such as real-time communication
- `Crypto Wallet`, used to manage financial activities and assets 

In summary, `Prople` provides an *actor agent*, an ecosystem, and an open, decentralized and P2P networks to provides solution for the three important domains:

- `Decentralized Identity` 
- `Decentralized Social`
- `Decentralized Finance` 

> `Prople` has a mission and vision to give back the true ownership and control back to the people.
